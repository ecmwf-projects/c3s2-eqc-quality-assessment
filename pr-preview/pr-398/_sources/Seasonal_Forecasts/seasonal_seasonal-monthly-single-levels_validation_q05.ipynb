    "### 1. Why the multi-model ensemble (MME) \n",
    "There are two main sources of error which affect the performance of seasonal climate predictions in terms of reliability, accuracy and ultimately their usability and value for sectoral applications: \n",
    " * the initial condition uncertainties associated to the knowledge of the current state of the climate system, which is the starting point of a forecast [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.49712252905); \n",
    " * the errors introduced by climate models, which describe the climate system by means of a finite number - albeit an incredibly large one - of interacting elements and by a set of empirical parametrizations and approximations of physical processes [[5]](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.49712757202).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first source of error is, to a large extent, unavoidable because it is associated with the limits of the global observing system and to the techniques adopted to extract information from observations. This limit is generally addressed by producing the largest possible ensembles of forecasts with similar initial conditions. The objective of producing large ensembles of forecasts is not necessarily, and only, the elimination or reduction of the forecast uncertainty. Instead, large ensembles aim at providing more robust statistics and produce the largest range of possible outcomes associated with uncertainty of the state of the climate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second source of errors depends on the overall modelling approach, on the parameterizations adopted for some physical processes in the climate system, and on the specific solutions adopted for implementation of each climate modelling system. A fundamental goal of climate modelers is to reduce this kind of error as much as possible, in order to avoid the systematic misrepresentation of key features of the climate system (the so-called model bias), and the associated impact on essential climate variables such as precipitation intensity, temperature, or wind patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MME approach addresses the second source of error by leveraging the underlying assumption that seasonal predictions produced by different forecasting centers can be considered as the members of a single statistical ensemble. A further assumption is that the systematic errors produced by different climate models can partially compensate each other if the technical choices made for their development are sufficiently independent."

For this application the mosaic method outperforms the average method and, by definition, it also outperforms the performance of individual forecasting systems.

    "### 3. Technical aspects in using the MME approach\n",
    "The MME approach is designed to address multiple sources of climate model uncertainty, including not only differences in the numerical approximations to the governing physical equations, but also variations arising from ensemble size, sampling of initial condition uncertainty, data assimilation techniques, and other aspects of the modeling systems. By combining outputs from multiple models, the MME approach aims to provide more robust and reliable projections than single models alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two main groups of post-processing approaches are adopted to implement the MME approach:\n",
    "\n",
    " * the bias adjustment and recalibration methods applied to the output of individual forecasting systems [[20]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04640-4);\n",
    " * the combination of predictions issued with different forecasting systems [[21]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5433.1548) [[22]](https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v57i3.14657).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bias adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias adjustment and recalibration methods have been tested systematically on the datasets available on the Copernicus Data Store [[21]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5433.1548). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the multi-model approach based on combining predictions from different systems assumes that climate models are sufficiently independent to improve or at least partially compensate for the respective errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been demonstrated, using both toy-models and actual climate model simulations, that multi-model ensembles can outperform a ‘best-model’ approach because multi-model combinations reduce the average ensemble mean error at the cost of widening the spread of the overall ensemble [[23]](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.210).\n",
    "\n",
    "A systematic, effective  approach for the creation of multimodel ensemble, tested on C3S includes, recalibration and the equally weighting of all members of the multi-model ensemble [[24]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05314-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combination\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the multi-model approach is expected to bring much of its added value in the tropics, where the combination of models in a single grand-ensemble can offset errors affecting the predictable components of the climate system [[25]](https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v57i3.14658).\n",
    "\n",
    "In extratropical regions, e.g. over Europe, the multi-model does not always perform better than the best single models, therefore it is advisable to test the single models for each application [[26]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4404-z). The figure below shows an example of how different models can be more skillful over different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal forecasting studies employ different approaches to generate multi‐model ensembles. As examples:\n",
    "\n",
    " - simple equal‐weight pooling appears in four studies [[25]](https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v57i3.14658) [[24]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05314-2);\n",
    "\n",
    " - regression‐based optimal weighting [[26]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4404-z) [[25]](https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v57i3.14658); \n",
    "\n",
    " - bayesian methods [[27]](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR2818.1);\n",
    "\n",
    " - performance-based objective weighting approaches [[28]](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-84-12-1783).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complementarity of bias adjustment and combination\n",
    "\n",
    "While bias correction and model combination are sometimes discussed separately, they are in fact complementary components of the multi-model ensemble framework rather than competing alternatives. Bias correction improves the performance of individual models, ensuring that each contributes more reliable information to the ensemble. Model combination, in turn, integrates the corrected forecasts from multiple systems to capture a broader range of plausible outcomes and reduce the influence of any single model’s systematic deficiencies. When used together, these approaches enhance both the calibration and robustness of seasonal forecasts—bias correction refining the inputs, and combination optimizing the synthesis of predictive information.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The Signal to Noise Paradox\n",
    "The systematic analysis of climate forecasts has revealed the existence of the so-called Signal-to-Noise Paradox (SNP). This paradox refers to the unexpected situation in which seasonal forecast models can predict the observed climate anomalies more accurately than they can predict their own internal variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in winter NAO forecasts, the ensemble mean can anticipate whether the season will be dominated by a positive or negative NAO phase (i.e. stronger or weaker westerly winds over the North Atlantic) even though the individual ensemble members within the same model vary so much from each other that, taken separately, they appear to have very little predictive power. The mismatch between good prediction of reality despite weak internal consistency defines the Signal-to-Noise Paradox. [[29]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-018-0038-4) \n",
    "\n",
    "This is paradoxical because, in principle, if the model is realistic, the predictability within the model’s ensemble should be similar to that of the real world. The existance of a Signal-to-Noise Paradox suggests that the models are underestimating amplitude of their own predictable signal or overestimating internal noise, pointing to systematic deficiencies in the forecasting systems, which are still unclear. [[30]](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-24-0019.1). \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it has been shown that, in a multi-model ensemble, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can offer valuable insights into forecast reliability. In particular, years characterised by a high SNR tend to exhibit, on average, larger observed deviations from the mean than years with a low SNR, for both near-surface temperature (T2m) and precipitation. This suggests that forecast systems might be more reliable in predicting large anomalies (e.g., extremes) when there is greater coherence among ensemble members [[31]](https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-823-2023)."

    "\n",
    "In this case, the seasonal outlook is not designed for specific applications. The multi-model ensemble (MME) forecast is calculated as a weighted average of the ensemble means from eight component models: ECMWF, Met Office, Météo-France, CMCC, DWD, NCEP, JMA, and ECCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighting ensures that each component contributes equally to the overall variance of the multi-model during the common hindcast period.\n",
    "For each component model, ensemble mean anomalies are calculated relative to its own model climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing the multi-model mean, the weight assigned to each component is determined by dividing the square root of the average variance across all systems by the square root of the variance of the respective component.\n",

    "The use of a multi-model approach is case specific and there is no evidence of a single standard approach to be adopted as an all-purpose solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, bias adjustment is essential when preparing the (usually daily based) input for downstream impact models, such as crop models or energy production models. In such circumstances, the added value of a multi-model approach may be off-set by the computational demand of the processing chain. On the other hand, recalibration approaches improve the overall reliability of seasonal indicators by building on the temporal correspondence between the ensemble mean predictions and the corresponding observations [[21]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5433.1548)."
