    "### 1. Why the multi-model ensemble (MME) \n",
    "There are two main sources of error which affect the performance of seasonal climate predictions in terms of reliability, accuracy and ultimately their usability and value for sectoral applications: \n",
    " * the initial condition uncertainties associated to the knowledge of the current state of the climate system, which is the starting point of a forecast [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.49712252905); \n",
    " * the errors introduced by climate models, which describe the climate system by means of a finite number - albeit an incredibly large one - of interacting elements and by a set of empirical parametrizations and approximations of physical processes [[5]](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.49712757202).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first source of error is, to a large extent, unavoidable because it is associated with the limits of the global observing system and to the techniques of extracting useful information from observations. This limit is generally addressed by producing the largest possible ensembles of forecasts with similar initial conditions. The objective of producing large ensembles of forecasts is not necessarily, and only, the elimination or reduction of the forecast uncertainty. Instead, large ensembles aim at providing more robust statistics and produce the largest range of possible outcomes associated with uncertainty of the the state of the climate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second source of errors depends on the overall modelling approach, on the parameterizations adopted for some physical processes in the climate system, and on the specific solutions adopted for implementation of each climate modelling system. A fundamental goal of climate modelers is to reduce this kind of errors as much as possible, in order to avoid the systematic misrepresentation of key features of the climate system (the so-called model bias), and the associated impact on essential climate variables such as precipitation intensity, temperature, or wind patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MME approach addresses the second source of error by leveraging the underlying assumption that seasonal predictions produced by different forecasting centers can be considered as the members of a single statistical ensemble. A further assumption is that the systematic errors produced by different climate models can partially compensate each other if the technical choices made for their development are sufficiently independent."

Within the mosaic method, the single best-performing forecasting system is selected for each location and cropping season, based on the corresponding grid-based skill score for yield variability. This study uses only one of the models available in C3S (NCEP) along with other SF available from other forecasting centres (APEC Climate Center, Korea; Meteorological Service of Canada; NASA; Pusan National University, Korea). For this application the mosaic method outperforms the average method and, by definition, it also outperforms the performance of individual forecasting systems.

    " * the bias adjustment and recalibration methods applied to the output of individual forecasting systems [[20]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04640-4);\n",
    " * the combination of predictions issued with different forecasting systems [[21]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5433.1548) [[22]](https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v57i3.14657).\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the multi-model approach based on combining predictions from different systems assumes that climate models are sufficiently independent to improve or at least partially compensate for the respective errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been demonstrated, using both toy-models and actual climate model simulations, that multi-model ensembles can outperform a ‚Äòbest-model‚Äô approach because multi-model combinations reduce the average ensemble mean error at the cost of widening the spread of the overall ensemble [[23]](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.210).\n",
    "\n",
    "A systematic, effective  approach for the creation of multimodel ensemble, tested on C3S  includes recalibration and the equally weighting of all members of the multi-model ensemble [[24]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05314-2).\n",

    "\n",
    "In extratropical regions, e.g. over Europe, the multi-model does not always perform better than the best single models, therefore it is advisable to test the single models for each application [[26]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4404-z). The figure below shows an example of how different models can be more skillful over different areas.\n",

    "#### The Signal to Noise Paradox\n",
    "The systematic analysis of climate forecasts has revealed the existence of the so-called Signal-to-Noise Paradox (SNP), whereby model ensembles demonstrate greater skill in predicting certain aspects of observed climate variability‚Äîsuch as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)‚Äîthan in predicting the variability within individual ensemble members. This paradox is thought to arise from deficiencies in the forecasting systems, the causes of which are still unclear [[27]](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-24-0019.1). Nonetheless, it has been shown that, in a multi-model ensemble, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can offer valuable insights into forecast reliability. In particular, years characterised by a high SNR tend to exhibit, on average, larger observed deviations from the mean than years with a low SNR, for both near-surface temperature (T2m) and precipitation. This suggests that forecast systems might be more reliable in predicting large anomalies (e.g., extremes) when there is greater coherence among ensemble members [[28]](https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-823-2023)."

    "In this case, the seasonal outlook is not designed for specific applications. The multi-model ensemble (MME) forecast is calculated as a weighted average of the ensemble means from eight component models: ECMWF, Met Office, M√©t√©o-France, CMCC, DWD, NCEP, JMA, and ECCC.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The use of a multi-model approach is case specific and there is no evidence of a single standard approach to be adopted as an all-purpose solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, bias adjustment is essential when preparing the (usually daily based) input for downstream impact models, such as crop models or energy production models. In such circumstances, the added value of a multi-model approach may be off-set by the computational demand of the processing chain. On the other hand, recalibration approaches improve the overall reliability of seasonal indicators by building on the temporal correspondence between the ensemble mean predictions and the corresponding observations [[21]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5433.1548)."
