    "Traditional altimetry has been often unable to produce meaningful signals of sea level change in the coastal zone due to the typically shallower water, bathymetric gradients and shoreline shapes, among others [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-019-09569-1), [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12233970). Actually, satellite sea level products are not optimized for the coastal band promoting larger errors in the retrieval of sea level with regard to the open ocean. Nevertheless, the monitoring of sea level changes in coastal areas is an important societal issue [[3]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15030793). Thus, most of the efforts of the international community in the recent past have been focused on the research and development of techniques for coastal altimetry, with substantial support from space agencies such as the European Space Agency (ESA), the Centre National d‚Äô√âtudes Spatiales (CNES) and other research institutions [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-016-9392-0). Efforts of the coastal altimetry community are aimed at extending the capabilities of current altimeters closer to the coastal zone. This includes the application of improved geophysical corrections, data recovery strategies near the coast using new editing criteria and high-frequency along-track sampling associated with updated quality control procedures [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-019-09569-1).\n",
    "As a result, regional altimeter products focused on the coastal zone have been developed over the last years [[3]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15030793). These products are disseminated to both the international scientific community and society through regular specific coastal altimetry workshops.\n",
    "Different metrics are used to assess the quality of satellite sea level data. They mainly consist in the analysis of the sea level anomaly (SLA) field at different steps of the processing, checks of the consistency of the SLA along the tracks of different altimeters and between gridded and along-track products, and comparisons with external in situ measurements [[5]](https://catalogue.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-SL-QUID-008-032-068.pdf).\n",
    "In situ and satellite observations are complementary and are often assumed to observe the same signals [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015RG000502). In coastal areas, tide gauge measurements are commonly used (e.g., [[7]](https://doi.org/10.5194/os-15-1207-2019)). \n",
    "In this context, this notebook aims to evaluate the performance of satellite global sea level gridded products in the retrieval of sea level in the coastal band of the European Seas over the period 1993-2020. This assessment is based on the analysis conducted in [[8]](https://doi.org/10.5194/os-19-793-2023) from satellite sea level data."

    ":class: note\n",
    "* The mean value of the rms difference between the vDT2021 satellite dataset and tide gauges along the coastal band of the European Seas is 4.35 cm, the variance of the differences (satellite ‚Äì tide gauge) is 19 cm¬≤ whilst the variance of the satellite and tide gauge datasets are 89 cm¬≤ and 79 cm¬≤, respectively. Thus, this dataset properly captures the sea level in the coastal region of the European Seas and its variability when compared with in-situ tide gauge data. In addition, the mean distance between the location of the tide gauges and the corresponding satellite data with the highest correlation is 87 km. \n",
    "* The mean value of the rms difference between the vDT2018 version and tide gauges is 4.41 cm, the variance of the differences (altimetry‚Äìtide gauge) is 19 cm¬≤, and the mean distance between the location of the tide gauge and the corresponding satellite data is 90 km. Thus, compared to its predecessor, vDT2018, the vDT2021 dataset shows only slight improvements. The average difference with tide gauges decreased by just 1%, and the mean distance between tide gauges and the most correlated satellite data points was reduced by 3% (from 90 km to 87 km), whereas the variance of the differences between the datasets is quite similar. \n",
    "* Consistency between the satellite dataset vDT2021 and the tide gauge data shows spatial variability. In the central and eastern Baltic Sea, differences are under 5%, confirming the accuracy of the satellite corrections applied in this area. However, in regions connected to the North Atlantic, such as the Strait of Gibraltar and along the Atlantic shore, discrepancies increase, ranging between 20% and 50%. This could be due to inaccuracies in corrections (i.e. ocean tide and DAC) applied to the satellite data, as well as greater variability in non-tidal sea level changes. The Norwegian Sea shows better results than those obtained for the Atlantic shore with consistency values ranging between 15 % and 30 %, except for the south-western part of Norway where even better values ranging between 5 % and 15% are obtained providing accurate sea level measurements when compared with tide gauges.\n",
    "* Linear trends derived from the vDT2021 satellite dataset indicate a consistent sea level rise along the European coasts and the western Mediterranean, with values ranging from 2.60 to 3.80 mm yr‚Åª¬π and a mean trend for the whole domain of 3.13 mm yr‚Åª¬π. In contrast, trends computed from tide gauge records display a more heterogeneous spatial pattern, with values ranging between 1.30 and 3 mm yr‚Åª¬π and a mean trend for the whole domain of 1.96 mm yr‚Åª¬π. These results provide further evidence of the European seas coastal sea level rise, including the westernmost part of the Mediterranean Sea. Overall, linear trend differences (satellite ‚Äì tide gauge) for the vDT2021 dataset vary, in absolute value, from 0.03 to 2.65 mm yr‚Åª¬π, with an average of 1.40 mm yr‚Åª¬π. These low discrepancies corroborate the agreement and complementarity of the two techniques to measure sea level variability in the coastal zone. However, this translates into vDT2021 satellite measurements not being accurate enough in the coastal zone.\n",

    "Before they can be compared with satellite data, tide gauge measurements have to be processed to remove oceanographic signals whose temporal periods are not resolved by satellite sea level data, thus avoiding important aliasing errors [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-019-09569-1). In the following there are summarised the corrections applied to the tide gauge records:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correction of oceanic tidal effects by filtering tidal components (mainly diurnal and semidiurnal tidal constituents). The u-tide software [[12]](https://www.po.gso.uri.edu/codiga/utide/2011Codiga-UTide-Report.pdf) is used. The annual and semiannual frequencies, mainly driven by steric effect, are kept in the tidal residuals since they are included in the satellite data.\n",
    "* Removal of the atmospheric induced sea level variability caused by the action of atmospheric pressure and wind [[13]](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0426%281999%29016<1279:EOGMAP>2.0.CO;2), [[14]](https://doi.org/10.1029/2002GL016473). The same dynamic atmospheric correction (DAC) as for satellite data is applied for the sake of consistency. The 6-hourly fields of this correction, available from the Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic Data (AVISO) website [[DAC entry]](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/dynamic-atmospheric-correction.html), are used. For each tide gauge site, the nearest grid point was selected and used to remove the atmospherically induced sea level from observations, previously converted into 6-hourly records [[15]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2015.04.027).\n",
    "* Correction of vertical movements associated with glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). GIA is regarded as the only source of vertical land motions. Its effects are removed from the sea surface height (SSH) records, previously averaged into daily data, by using the Peltier mantle viscosity model (VM2) [[16]](https://doi.org/10.1029/98RG02638), [[17]](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.earth.32.082503.144359).\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison method of satellite data with tide gauges consists in collocating both datasets in time and space. As a first step, a 15 day low-pass LOESS filter is applied to satellite and tide gauge time series to remove the high frequencies that cannot be resolved by the satellite data [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12233970), [[18]](https://doi.org/10.1175/2008JTECHO556.1), [[19]](https://doi.org/10.5194/os-15-1091-2019). Then, the correlations between each tide gauge record and SLA time series corresponding to grid points within a radius of 1 degree around the tide gauge site is computed and the most correlated altimetry point is chosen. Only long-term monitoring stations with a lifetime of more than 3 years are used to allow statistical significance. Statistical analyses are performed using all available data pairs (satellite ‚Äì tide gauge) in terms of the root mean square (rms) difference and variance of the time series.  Consistency between the satellite dataset and the tide gauge data is computed from Eq. (1) in [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12233970). It is expressed as the mean square differences between both datasets, computed as the variance of the differences (satellite ‚Äì tide gauge), in terms of percentage of the tide gauge variance.\n",

    "The mean value (Table 1) of the rms difference between the vDT2021 satellite dataset and tide gauges is 4.35 cm, the variance of the differences (satellite ‚Äì tide gauge) is 19 cm¬≤, whereas the variance of the satellite and tide gauge datasets are 79 cm¬≤ and 89 cm¬≤, respectively. Thus, this dataset properly captures the sea level in the coastal region and its variability when compared with in-situ tide gauge data. In addition, the mean distance between the location of the tide gauge and the corresponding satellite data with the highest correlation is 87 km. Overall, consistency (Figure 1) between the vDT2021 satellite dataset and the tide gauge data (expressed according to [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12233970) as the mean square differences between both datasets in terms of percentage of the tide gauge variance) shows spatial variability with values lower than 5 % in the central and eastern parts of the Baltic Sea, emphasizing the precision of the correction applied to the satellite data in the basin that provides accurate sea level measurements when compared with tide gauges. However, they reach poorer values between 20 % and 30 % for stations located in the connection region with the North Atlantic Ocean. In addition, consistency values are between 20 % and 50 % for most of the stations located along the Atlantic shore; this includes the Strait of Gibraltar area. Such a large error could be related to imprecisions in the correction applied (i.e. ocean tide and DAC) to the satellite data [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12233970), [[9]](https://doi.org/10.1029/2007jc004459), [[10]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2016.03.006) and to a larger non-tidal variance with respect to that found in the Baltic Sea [[11]](https://doi.org/10.1080/1755876X.2018.1489208). Finally, the Norwegian Sea shows consistency values better than those obtained for the Atlantic shore ranging between 15 % and 30 %, except for the south-western part of Norway where values between 5 % and 15% are found providing accurate sea level measurements when compared with tide gauges."

    "Linear trends computed from the vDT2018 dataset (figure not shown) exhibit quite a similar spatial pattern to that reported for the vDT2021 version with overall values ranging from 2.40 to 3.60 mm yr‚Åª¬π in the Baltic and Mediterranean seas and between 2.10 and 2.85 mm yr‚Åª¬π along the North Atlantic European coasts. This promotes a mean trend for the whole domain of 2.85 mm yr‚Åª¬π. Thus, some differences in range are observed between the two versions, with a lower variability observed for the vDT2018 dataset. \n",
    "This fact has an impact on the spatial distribution of the differences between the vDT2021 and vDT2018 versions (Figure 5). It depicts a homogeneous spatial pattern with overall larger trends for the vDT2021 dataset except for a tide gauge station located in the connection region between the Baltic Sea and the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Figure 5 also reveals, when making a comparison with linear trends from tide gauges, that the vDT2021 dataset presents larger differences with tide gauges with respect to the vDT2018 version in the whole domain."
