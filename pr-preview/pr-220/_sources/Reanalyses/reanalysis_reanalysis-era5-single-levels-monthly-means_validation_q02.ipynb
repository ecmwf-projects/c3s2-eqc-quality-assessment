Here we extract results from three recent papers, which concentrate on evaluating the latest reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), ERA5, in its capability to correctly represent the wind speed both at surface and at the wind turbine hub heights, over those regions where the wind speed is significant for the wind energy production. \n",

    "Typical modern turbine hub heights are between 80 and 120 m, which can be preferable to surface level measurements when considering the absence of surrounding obstructions and thus for wind field monitoring and applications in power generation. At the same time, the maintenance of these structures is much more expensive than that of the surface stations, and therefore these data appear scarce, or make up timeseries that are not always long enough to serve the purpose."
