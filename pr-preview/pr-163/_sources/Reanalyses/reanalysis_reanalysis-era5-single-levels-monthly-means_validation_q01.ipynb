    "By comparing model results with relevant observations, differences between the model and observations can be identified and quantified. However, the validation of reanalysis products over remote areas is difficult due to the scarcity of reliable in situ measurements. In this case, the latest reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), ERA5, was validated with data collected during the 2022 and 2023 campaigns by the Aeroclipper platform [[1]](#paul-poli). The Aeroclipper is a quasi-Lagrangian balloon that provides in situ measurements of atmospheric parameters at heights of 30-40 metres above the ocean [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1175/2008BAMS2500.1), representative of the bottom of the boundary layer that strongly interacts with turbulent flows (momentum, energy, water) at the ocean-atmosphere interface. This balloon is an interesting tool for assessing the representation of the surface layer of the atmosphere by meteorological models and reanalyses, because it can provide high-frequency and high-quality measurements - i.e. not disturbed by the mass of a ship - on quasi-Lagrangian trajectories, which can be compared with gridded data.

    "The analysis shows that the model levels (i.e. above 10 m) underestimate the specific humidity at the Aeroclipper height. The timeseries of the model levels lay systematically below the Aeroclipper signal, with very few exceptions. Distribution shows specifically the second level at 31 m, which is the one in the middle but still representative of all the three levels which are very close to each other, and it can be noticed that most values are negative and the difference is peaked around -1 and -2 g/kg. The underestimation of specific humidity in the first three model levels appears to be, at least in part, related to the assimilation process, which tends to dry out these model levels at the beginning of each 12-hour assimilation window [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1256/qj.05.137). Dampening then follows, but without reaching an equilibrium or a value close to those observed. At 2 m, the drying due to assimilation is less and the humidity reaches equilibrium a few hours after forecast starts, so the specific humidity at 2 m is in better agreement with the Aeroclipper measurements, but still with a negative bias. This leads to the conclusion that the vertical moisture gradients in the surface layer of the atmosphere are too large in ERA5 compared to the Aeroclipper measurements. Data obtained from field campaigns are a useful complement to global datasets to perform validation, see e.g. Johnston et al., 2021 [[5]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13050880)."

    "Analysis shows that the air temperature is underestimated by about 1 K in ERA5 compared to Aeroclipper measurements. Looking at the timeseries, underestimation can be noticed for the three model levels and for the 2m level. In most cases, the temperature at 2 m is similar to the temperature at the first three model levels and is sometimes even smaller. As showed in the distributions panel, where can be noticed that most values are negative and the difference is peaked around -1 K, the bias tends to be larger during the night and only marginally impacted by the diurnal cycle. Bias seems to be due to overcooling of the surface layer by the model, which occurs especially at night during the forecasts, and corrected in part by the assimilation process [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1256/qj.05.137)."

    "In the figure above, equivalent brightness temperature values have been compared with the ERA5 skin and sea surface temperature (SKT and SST). During the period of measurements, the ERA5 SKT is generally smaller than the ERA5 SST. At the same time, SKT is slightly larger than the radiative temperature measurement of the Aeroclipper, so that vertical gradients of temperature in the atmospheric surface layer represented in ERA5 result to be too large compared with Aeroclipper measurements. However, it should be noted that the skin temperature measured by Aeroclipper is not corrected for the radiative processes occurring between the surface and the instrument itself (see i.e. [[6]](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/6/1451)), partly explaining the ERA5 overestimation. Nevertheless, this result is in agreement with the one in He et al., 2023 [[7]](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3312810), in which in-situ and satellite data are used to validate ERA5 near-surface air temperature over global oceans (see e.g. Fig. 11 in the reference).

    "The distribution is skewed towards negative values, peaked between -1.5 and 0 m/s, showing that the wind speed is underestimated in ERA5 compared to Aeroclipper measurements. Looking at the timeseries, general underestimation can be noted as well, and it is greater during convective episodes associated with convective cold pools and large wind gusts (see e.g. around 22 September). This bias in the wind speed therefore seems to be partly related to the lack of cold pools in the model. This result showing too little wind shear near the surface in ERA5 is in agreement with that of Campos et al. [[8]](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14194918), where in-situ and satellite data are used to validate the wind speed of ERA5 over the Atlantic Ocean (see e.g. Fig. 4 in the reference). "
