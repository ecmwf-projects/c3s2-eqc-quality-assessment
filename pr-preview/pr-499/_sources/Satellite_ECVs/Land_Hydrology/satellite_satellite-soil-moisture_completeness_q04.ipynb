    "The Earth's climate and its evolution are determined by interactions between land surfaces, the atmosphere, the ocean and ice caps under the atmospheric composition and the forcing of solar radiation. For these reasons, numerical models must couple all these components of the system when used to develop climate projections in order to anticipate the impacts of climate change. In this general framework, interactions between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere strongly modulate regional climate. They are based on a complex overlap of multiple land-atmosphere feedback processes and also depend on the representation of soil moisture. However, simulated soil moisture does not have an unambiguous meaning. It is a highly model-specific quantity, with a dynamic range defined by the specific evaporation and runoff formulations used by the given model, as well as model-specific soil parameters such as porosity, hydraulic conductivity, wilting point and layer depth. Even when the models are driven by exactly the same meteorological forcing, large differences in soil moisture products generated by different land models can be observed [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1175/2009JCLI2832.1).\n",

The variable $\\rho_{w}$ is the density of liquid water, assumed to be a constant value of 1000 $kg/m³$. The quantity $𝑑𝑧(𝑖)$ refers to the thickness of the 𝑖-th soil layer in meters $[m]$, which is used to compute the volumetric contribution of each layer. The term $z_{remaining}$ represents the portion in $[m]$ of the final layer that partially overlaps with the target integration depth, defining the vertical extent over which SM is integrated. This formula first converts each layer’s SM from mass per unit area $[kg\\ m-2]$ to volumetric SM $[m3/m3]$ by dividing by the product of water density and layer thickness. Then, it multiplies by the layer thickness to compute the volume per unit area. Summing over all layers and dividing by the total soil depth yields the average volumetric SM over the target depth.

    "The figure above presents Taylor plots comparing model performance with the SM reference datasets used. These plots show that the models generally capture the correlation and spatial patterns of surface SM well, albeit with varying degrees of bias and dispersion. It can also be noted that the models show a greater ability to capture correlations than standard deviations, suggesting that they better represent relative patterns of moisture and drought than absolute levels of soil moisture. The considerable dispersion in soil moisture estimates among CMIP6 models reflects differences in how LSM models represent key processes and input data. The variability observed in soil moisture simulations between CMIP6 models likely stems from a combination of factors, including differences in soil properties, legacy input datasets, timing of precipitation events, hydrological parameterisations and process representations, as well as feedback mechanisms."
