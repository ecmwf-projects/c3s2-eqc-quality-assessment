The Documentation ([[13]](http://wdc.dlr.de/C3S_312b_Lot2/Documentation/GHG/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_GHG_main_latest.pdf), [[14]](http://wdc.dlr.de/C3S_312b_Lot2/Documentation/GHG/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_GHG_A_latest.pdf), [[15]](http://wdc.dlr.de/C3S_312b_Lot2/Documentation/GHG/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_GHG_B_latest.pdf)) related  to the dataset “Carbon dioxide data from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations” [[9]](https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2023/greenhouse-gas-fluxes) was inspected. Level 2 data product based on GOSAT and GOSAT-2 measurements (CO2_GOS_SRFP v2.3.8, CO2_GOS_OCFP v7.3, CO2_GO2_SRFP v2.1.0) are characterised by a 9.7 km (diameter) footprint with the single observations typically on the order of 100 km apart with a 6-day repeat cycle. According to [[5]](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/14233/2019/), the lower data density of GOSAT observations with respect to OCO-2 may potentially affect the quantification of carbon fluxes but no conclusive statements were made on this topic: as also demonstrated by a number of available case studies (e.g., [[3]](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-13739-2014), [[7]](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4339-2021), [[9]](https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2023/greenhouse-gas-fluxes)), this does not prevent the use of GOSAT observations within atmospheric inversion systems."

    "As documented by [[5]](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/14233/2019/) and [[6]](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-12067-2019), both OCO-2 and GOSAT observations are not evenly distributed spatially. Due to cloud contamination, there are few retrievals in a large portion of tropical land. Moreover, available satellite retrievals are very sparse in the northern high-latitude area, especially in boreal regions, due to the occurrence of low solar zenith angles (SZAs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Documentation on \"Carbon dioxide data from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations\" ([[13]](http://wdc.dlr.de/C3S_312b_Lot2/Documentation/GHG/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_GHG_main_latest.pdf), [[14]](http://wdc.dlr.de/C3S_312b_Lot2/Documentation/GHG/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_GHG_A_latest.pdf), [[15]](http://wdc.dlr.de/C3S_312b_Lot2/Documentation/GHG/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_GHG_B_latest.pdf)) was examined. With respect to spatial completeness GOSAT data products (CO2_GOS_SRFP v2.3.8, CO2_GOS_OCFP v7.3, CO2_GO2_SRFP v2.1.0) are characterised by low data coverage at high latitudes (due to unfavourable illumination conditions) and over the tropics (due to frequent cloud contamination).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because high SZAs, which are typical of regions at high latitudes, complicate retrievals due to weaker illumination. This reduces the satellite radiance signal, making retrievals noisier and more uncertain. Furthermore, the long slant paths under high SZAs amplify the influence of aerosol scattering and cirrus clouds, which can result in errors in the retrieved gas amount. When clouds are present, they act as opaque or semi-opaque barriers to the solar radiation reflected at the Earth’s surface, meaning that the radiation reflected from the cloud top does not carry information about the gases below the clouds. Furthermore, they cause multiple scattering and path-length uncertainty, which can affect satellite radiance observations in the near infrared/short wave infrared (NIR/SWIR) spectral region. However, as reported by [[16]](http://wdc.dlr.de/C3S_312b_Lot2/Documentation/GHG/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_GHG_D_latest.pdf), the specific retrieval difficulties depend on the retrieval algorithm adopted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even thin clouds (optical thickness < 0.3) scatter sunlight strongly In regions characvterised by high cloud coverage, the signal of the solar radiation reflected at the Earth’s surface and observed by satellites is i Users should be aware that the impact of satellite XCO$_2$ data on the carbon fluxes diagnosed by the inversion system may be related to the spatial coverage and the amount of data of the XCO$_2$ datasets (see [[6]](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-12067-2019)): in general, in regions characterised by low data coverage, the carbon fluxes diagnosed by the inversion system are dominated by the information provided by the a-priori field.  \n",
