    "In the United Kingdom, the record-breaking hot and dry spring and summer of 2025 caused harvest losses worth more than £800 million [[ECIU+25](https://eciu.net/analysis/reports/2025/estimated-financial-losses-faced-by-uk-farmers-due-dry-weather-impacts-on-key-arable-crops)].\n",
    "An 18-month drought in Brazil in 2023–24,\n",
    "the most severe since monitoring began in 1954,\n",
    "led to 720 health centres in affected areas becoming non-operational [[UNICEF+24](https://www.unicef.org/media/165191/file/LACR-Flash-Update-11-November-2024.pdf)].\n",
    "Finally, extreme rainfall killed hundreds of people and caused billions of € of damages in Spain in 2024 [[Franch-Pardo+25](https://doi.org/10.48088/ejg.i.fra.16.2.286.297)].\n",
    "Climate change is thought to be the primary driver behind the increase in drought and extreme precipitation events since the 1950s [[IPCC+23](https://doi.org/10.59327/IPCC/AR6-9789291691647)],\n",
    "and this trend is expected to continue into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these impacts,\n",
    "monitoring drought and extreme precipitation is vital.\n",
    "Several quantitative proxies have been developed to aid in this monitoring,\n",
    "generally based on\n",
    "(a combination of)\n",
    "total precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and surface (air) temperature.\n",
    "Two widely-employed indices are the \n",
    "_Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI)_ [[McKee+93](https://climate.colostate.edu/pdfs/relationshipofdroughtfrequency.pdf)]\n",
    "and\n",
    "_Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)_ [[Vicente-Serrano+10](https://doi.org/10.1175/2009JCLI2909.1)].\n",
    "Both operate on the same principle,\n",
    "namely quantifying the amount of precipitation\n",
    "over a given time frame at a given location\n",
    "relative to its historical climatology.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "an SPI value of +1 corresponds to a precipitation that is 1 standard deviation above the mean,\n",
    "for that site and time frame.\n",
    "This probabilistic approach lends itself to statements on the occurrence rate of extreme events [[McKee+93](https://climate.colostate.edu/pdfs/relationshipofdroughtfrequency.pdf)].\n",
    "SPEI expands on SPI by including not just gains from precipitation, but also losses due to evapo(transpi)ration.\n",
    "SPI and SPEI can be evaluated over different _accumulation periods_ to probe phenomena at different time scales [[Keune+25](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04896-y), [EDO+25](https://drought.emergency.copernicus.eu/data/factsheets/factsheet_spi.pdf)]:\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course,\n",
    "proxies like SPI and SPEI depend on reliable input data in the form of historical meteorological time series.\n",
    "Weather stations can provide these data with high accuracy and precision for specific sites,\n",
    "but their coverage is sparse and their data are not always interoperable.\n",
    "Reanalyses,\n",
    "which integrate observations and forecast modelling,\n",
    "can provide similar data consistently with long-term global coverage.\n",
    "For example, ECMWF's fifth-generation reanalysis _ERA5_ provides meteorological data on a global ~31 km grid\n",
    "going back to 1940 [[Soci+24](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.4803), [Hersbach+20](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3803)].\n",

    "[available from the Climate Data Store](https://doi.org/10.24381/9bea5e16).\n",
    "This derived dataset can be a valuable resource for applications in many sectors,\n",
    "since it can be used out of the box,\n",
    "freeing users from the need to find and process the underpinning meteorological data themselves.\n",
    "ERA5–Drought provides SPI and SPEI for 7 different accumulation periods,\n",
    "interpolated to a 0.25° × 0.25° grid.\n",
    "It includes ERA5's deterministic reanalysis as well as 10 propagated members of the ERA5-EDA ensemble.\n",
    "The latter can be used to quantify the uncertainty in SPI or SPEI resulting from uncertainty in the input data.\n",
    "Moreover, ERA5–Drought provides multiple quality flags that can be used to filter data that do not meet the requirements for SPI or SPEI to be applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This quality assessment tests the consistency of ERA5–Drought with the underpinning ERA5 data in terms of its reproducibility.\n",
    "By manually reproducing SPI, SPEI, and the associated quality indicators from ERA5 data and comparing the results,\n",
    "we assess whether ERA5–Drought can indeed be used as a more convenient alternative to ERA5 for monitoring drought and extreme precipitation.\n",
    "Furthermore,\n",
    "any discrepancies found in the comparison shed light on caveats in the use of ERA5–Drought specifically and drought indicators broadly,\n",
    "such as the underlying assumptions.\n",

    "### 6. Conclusions\n",
    "**SPI**- As shown in Section 2, the C3S ERA5 Drought SPI‑Indicator dataset and its manually reproduced counterpart are highly consistent. This agreement is evident across the full time series at a point location in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as well as regionally over the Horn of Africa. The median difference and median absolute difference are both close to 0, and the vast majority of pixels exhibit a near‑zero difference (defined here as |Δ| ≤ ε with ε = 1×10⁻⁵ to avoid floating‑point artefacts) across all comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the \"probability of zero precipitation\" quality flag was also shown to be reproducible, globally, with no discrepancy. Since the Shapiro-Wilks quality flag is dependent on the dataset after statistical fitting, there was discrepancy at certain months, for Addis Ababa, and other locations...\n",
    "\n",
    "We also examined discrepancies in drought‑severity categorisation between the C3S ERA5‑Drought dataset and the manually reproduced counterpart at individual locations, including Addis Ababa, London, and Denver. While the severity classifications were generally consistent between ERA5‑Drought and the reproduced dataset, there were instances at specific timestamps where the two SPI indicators diverged sufficiently to fall into different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, \n",
    "\n",
    "**SPEI**- Following on from Section 3, \n",
    "\n",
    "**SPI/SPEI Ensemble**- Lastly, as was shown in Section 4, "
