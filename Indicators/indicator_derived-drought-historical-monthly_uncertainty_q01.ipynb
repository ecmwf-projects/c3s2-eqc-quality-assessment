This study evaluates how the uncertainty information from the ERA5-EDA ensemble can be directly integrated into the design and evaluation of drought evaluation tools. We assess their relevance for the agricultural and wider sector applications, particularly that with parametric insurance schemes that rely on weather data to underwrite crop‑related risk. "

    "### 4. Parametric insurance\n",
    "Based on the drought indices and the decision to use the time span of the drought indices that best explains volatility in rice production, a parametric insurance product can be developed. A parametric insurance contract that is based on weather indices (such as SPI for example) is fully defined through the sum insured, the trigger (also called strike), the limit and the modality of the pay-out function [[World Bank Group+18](https://doi.org/10.1596/29784)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers, limits, and the modality of the pay-out function are integral parts of the \"Indemnity Function\", where the parametric insurance contract protects against insufficient and/or excessive realisations of the underlying weather variable (e.g., rainfall deficit quantified through SPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Indemnity Function, $I$ that is based on the SPI is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = f(SPI \\mid x, Tr, Ex) = x \\times f(x) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0, & \\text{if } SPI > Tr, \\\\[6pt]\n",
    "\\dfrac{Tr - SPI}{Tr - Ex}, & \\text{if } Ex < SPI \\le Tr, \\\\[10pt]\n",
    "1, & \\text{if } SPI \\le Ex.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the sum insured, $Tr$ is the Trigger and $Ex$ is the Exit below which level pay-outs stop. Based on the sum insured, a tick size may be determined that consists of a monetary pay-out for each increment of the SPI index. \n",
    "\n",
    "Parametric insurance products have previously been developed by the World Bank for \"wet season rice\" and 4-months cumulative SPIs (January-April) for the Central Java region in Indonesia. In that study, the insured value of a ton of rice was set to USD 100, with the total theoretical sum insured set to USD 520,162,600. The trigger for a parametric insurance payout to start was taken to be -5, with an exit of an SPI value of -20 justified from historical rainfall data and climate projections. Indemnity would occur under the parametric insurance product for a total of 15 SPI values. For the study, a tick value of USD 6,666,667 was determined from the maximum production shortfall of 1 million tons, with the payout limit defined as USD 100,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERA5‑Drought product, which provides an estimate of uncertainty based on the 10‑member ensemble at a fine resolution, can be directly integrated into the design and evaluation of parametric insurance schemes. Incorporating this ensemble spread offers an explicit quantification of uncertainty around the underlying drought indicator, such as SPI, and therefore around potential payouts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we assess using the ERA5-Drought reanalysis and ensemble product to provide an estimate of the uncertainty in parametric insurance contract payouts. This enables insurers to better assess risk, refine calculations, and understand the robustness of the parametric insurance contract. It allows parametric insurance to be extended to regions where in-situ observations are sparse, and strengthens the feasibility of deploying scalable insurance products underpinned by weather data worldwide."
