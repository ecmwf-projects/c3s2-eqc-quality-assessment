    "Human-induced climate change is likely the primary driver behind the number of increased droughts and heavy precipitation since the 1950s, per the latest assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [[IPCC, 2023]](https://doi.org/10.59327/IPCC/AR6-9789291691647). With further global warming at 1.5°C and above, heavy precipitation, flooding and drought events are projected to intensify and become more frequent in most regions of Africa, Asia, North America and Europe. The environmental and societal impact of such extreme weather events are far-reaching. In the United Kingdom alone, the 2020s have seen three of the five worst harvests on record, with extreme heat and drought in 2025 causing more than £800mn lost revenue in harvest [[Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit]](https://mcusercontent.com/8ed7ad7972fae058e8f4fb7e8/files/6d02e6e7-8639-a44d-5a8c-2313124ef699/Costs_of_climate_analysis_011225.pdf). In 2023-2024, the Amazon region in Brazil faced an 18-month drought considered the most severe since drought monitoring began in 1954. By November 2024, it left 720 health centres in drought-affected areas of Brazil to become non-operational [[UNICEF, 2024]](https://www.unicef.org/media/165191/file/LACR-Flash-Update-11-November-2024.pdf). [**Mention opposite use case of extremely high precipitation**]\n",
    "\n",
    "A large scientific effort has gone into identifying areas more prone to drought along with monitoring areas currently experiencing drought conditions and accurately quantifying their severity. The objective quantification of drought severity remains an ongoing endeavour amongst scientists as there is not one physical variable that describes a drought. One might assume that drought severity can be measured by the total precipitation in that region, but this would overlook water-loss from the land surface through evapotranspiration, soil moisture levels, temperature anomalies and other natural variables. There is however consensus that drought indices, proxies based on long-term and shorter-term historical weather data, can accurately quantify drought severity and their impact, with studies linking the variability of drought indices to crop yields [[Vicente‐Serrano et al. , 2006.]](https://doi.org/10.1080/01431160500296032), and frequency of wildfires [[Russo, A et al. , 2017.]]((https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.01.021) ). Two widely-employed drought indices are the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) [[McKee et al. ,1993]](https://climate.colostate.edu/pdfs/relationshipofdroughtfrequency.pdf), endorsed by the World Metereological Organisation (WMO), and the more recent Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) [[Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010]](https://doi.org/10.1175/2009JCLI2909.1). **[why were they created, what is the difference, how are they used? The stuff about accumulation windows can also go here.]**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERA5-Drought dataset provides a reanalysis-based dataset of the aforementioned indices using the ECMWF Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5), at a resolution of 0.25° globally (around 28 km) from the start of the reanalysis (in 1940) to today [[Keune, J et al. , 2025.]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04896-y) . The ERA5-Drought dataset consists of 1 deterministic and 10 ensemble drought-index members from slightly different initial conditions, enabling an estimate of the uncertainty. [**The third paragraph should introduce ERA5 a bit more (couple sentences, including the reanalysis and ensemble components) and then go into ERA5-Drought as a more convenient point of access because it's pre-calculated.**]\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to give users much-needed confidence and transparency in the calculation of the SPI and SPEI drought indices along with their quality flags. The C3S ERA5-Drought dataset must be consistent with and reproducible from its origins. Here, we assess this consistency and reproducibility by comparing drought-indicators retrieved from the ERA5-Drought dataset with their equivalents calculated from the origin dataset (or similar). While a full analysis and reproduction of every record within the C3S ERA5-Drought dataset is outside the scope of quality assessment (as it would require high-performance computing infrastructure), a case study with a narrower scope probes these quality attributes of the dataset and can be a jumping-off point for further analysis by the reader."

    "### 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**SPI**- As shown in Section 2, the C3S ERA5 Drought SPI‑Indicator dataset and its manually reproduced counterpart are highly consistent. This agreement is evident across the full time series at a point location in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as well as regionally over the Horn of Africa. The median difference and median absolute difference are both close to 0, and the vast majority of pixels exhibit a near‑zero difference (defined here as |Δ| ≤ ε with ε = 1×10⁻⁵ to avoid floating‑point artefacts) across all comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the \"probability of zero precipitation\" quality flag was also shown to be reproducible, globally, with no discrepancy. Since the Shapiro-Wilks quality flag is dependent on the dataset after statistical fitting, there was discrepancy at certain months, for Addis Ababa, and other locations...\n",
    "\n",
    "We also examined discrepancies in drought‑severity categorisation between the C3S ERA5‑Drought dataset and the manually reproduced counterpart at individual locations, including Addis Ababa, London, and Denver. While the severity classifications were generally consistent between ERA5‑Drought and the reproduced dataset, there were instances at specific timestamps where the two SPI indicators diverged sufficiently to fall into different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, \n",
    "\n",
    "**SPEI**- Following on from Section 3, \n",
    "\n",
    "**SPI/SPEI Ensemble**- Lastly, as was shown in Section 4, "
