    "The [documentation for ERA5-Land](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5-Land%3A+data+documentation#heading-Accumulations) explains:\n",
    "> The accumulations in the short forecasts of ERA5-Land (with hourly steps from 01 to 24) are treated the same as those in ERA-Interim or ERA-Interim/Land, i.e., they are accumulated from the beginning of the forecast to the end of the forecast step. For example, runoff at day=D, step=12 will provide runoff accumulated from day=D, time=0 to day=D, time=12. The maximum accumulation is over 24 hours, i.e., from day=D, time=0 to day=D+1,time=0 (step=24). For the CDS time, or validity time, of 00 UTC, the accumulations are over the 24 hours ending at 00 UTC i.e. the accumulation is during the previous day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this means that one needs to download data for *day+1* (e.g. 2 January 2023) to get the total accumulated value for *day* (1 January 2023).\n",
    "Hence, for this specific dataset, our existing `request_time` will download data for 2022-12-31 – 2023-09-29, so we need to add one extra day.\n",
    "This is achieved by adding a second request for just the extra day to the earthkit-data download."
