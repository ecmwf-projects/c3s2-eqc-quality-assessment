    "\n",
    "GTTM uses a least squares linear fit (implemented through [`numpy.polyfit`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html)) to estimate and extrapolate a 30-year trend.\n",
    "While past and projected temperature curves are typically more complicated than a straight line [[20]](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3461-2016), a simple linear fit can adequately describe trends since the 1970s [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.12.005), especially for illustrative rather than predictive purposes.\n",
    "The 30-year range corresponds to the standard length of time used by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for climatology [[21]](https://community.wmo.int/en/activity-areas/climate-services/climate-products-and-initiatives/wmo-climatological-normals).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, for the period of January 1995 – January 2025, the best-fitting parameters are a slope $m$ = 0.00214 °C/month (0.0257 °C/year) and an offset $c$ = 0.604 °C, meaning the 1.5 °C threshold would be reached $(1.5\\,\\text{°C} \\, – \\, c)/m$ = 418.6 months from January 1995, or November–December 2029. The GTTM interface rounds this result down, in this example to November 2029.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `numpy.polyfit` routine can provide an uncertainty estimate in its outputs, representing the fit uncertainty due to the spread in the data but not the uncertainty in the data themselves. The corresponding estimated uncertainties are $\\sigma_m$ = 8.2 × 10<sup>–5</sup> °C/month (3.8%) and $\\sigma_c$ = 0.017 °C (2.8%), with a correlation coefficient of $r_{m,c}$ = –0.87 (i.e. strongly negatively correlated). The corresponding uncertainty $\\sigma_t$ in the month of reaching 1.5 °C $t$ can be estimated using a Taylor expansion, the correlated equivalent of the sum-of-squares method:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_t^2 = \\mathbf{J} \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{J}^\\top $$\n",

    "\n",
    "The resulting uncertainty is 10 months, or February 2029 – October 2030 in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a least squares fit for the regression line, rather than an alternative, does not significantly affect the result.\n",
    "For example, a Theil–Sen (median-of-slopes) estimator, implemented using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.TheilSenRegressor.html), provides an estimated slope $m$ = 0.00208 °C/month and offset $c$ = 0.594 °C for the same data.\n",
    "The equivalent date of reaching 1.5 °C would be April 2031.\n",
    "The scikit-learn method does not provide an uncertainty estimate on these parameters, and a manual calculation is outside the scope of this assessment.\n",
    "However, comparing the difference between the two linear estimators (16 months) to the uncertainty in one (10 months), the unknown uncertainty in the other, the uncertainty resulting from the anomaly calculation (see above), as well as the uncertainty in ERA5 data in general, it can be concluded that the difference is not significant and that the least squares fit is suitable."
