    "* **Are atmospheric models too cold in the mountain regions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite mountain areas covering a limited amount of land, they play a paramount role in the world‚Äôs water tower by supplying water for both natural and anthropogenic demands (Immerzeel et al., 2020 [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1822-y)). In many mountain regions, various water-related processes (such as the fraction of rain versus snow, snowmelt, and streamflow drought, e.g., Rudisill et al., 2024 [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-23-0082.1)) are linked to temperature conditions, making the mountain areas an indicator of the ongoing climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mountain terrains complicate the proper representation of temperature by models in those areas due to complex topography, slopes, aspect, terrain shadowing, snow-albedo feedbacks, and vegetation variability (*Figure .1*, reproduced from Rudisill et al., 2024 [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-23-0082.1)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to their higher resolution, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are expected to represent the dynamical and thermodynamic processes underlying temperature variability over complex orography more accurately than Global Climate Models (GCMs). However, RCMs still present biases over mountain regions. Among these, winter cold biases‚Äîespecially across peaks and ridges‚Äîare especially pronounced (Kotlarski et al., 2014 [[3]](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-1297-2014), Winter et al., 2017 [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3130-7), Matiu et al., 2019 [[5]](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11010046), Vautard et al., 2020 [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD032344), Sy et al., 2024 [[7]](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.8331)). Warm biases in summer have also been reported mainly in valley areas, but only in studies using convection-permitting RCMs (Rudisill et al., 2024 [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-23-0082.1), Napoli et al., 2023 [[8]](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.8222), Liu et al., 2017 [[9]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3327-9)); such fine-scale features are not captured by RCMs with coarser resolution. These temperature biases, consequently, impact their ability to properly represent snow-related processes in mountain areas (Matiu et al., 2019 [[5]](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11010046)). In fact, biases in temperature and snowpack, have a crucial knock-on effect on surface runoff, undermining the evaluation of the water-supplying capability of mountain ranges in Europe (Immerzeel et al., 2020 [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1822-y)). Those cascading effects are crucial for lowlands water availability (van Tiel et al., 2023 [[10]](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022EF003408)) and inherent economic sectors such as tourism, hydropower, and agriculture (Beniston et al., 2011 [[11]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2010.12.009))."

(2024) [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-23-0082.1) present a comprehensive list of possible mechanisms, including the representation of snow thermodynamics, elevation and orographic discrepancies due to grid spacing, and biases in radiation and wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other studies have explored specific factors contributing to these biases. For example, Garc√≠a-D√≠ez et al. (2015) [[19]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2529-x) remark a link between winter cold biases and snow-covered regions, highlighting a poor representation of snow-atmosphere interaction amplified by albedo feedback as a possible driver of the winter cold biases in RCMs. Moreover, the underestimation of cloud cover and consequent changes in incoming radiative fluxes (shortwave and longwave) may also influence temperature biases in Alpine areas (Vionnet et al., 2016 [[20]](https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-15-0241.1)).\n",

Their study indicates that biases in seasonal temperature increase with elevation, while also highlighting that observational datasets themselves are not immune to biases, making the choice of dataset for evaluation critical (also see Shrestha et al., 2023 [[21]](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli11070154)). *Figure .5c* (reproduced from  Matiu et al., 2024 [[14]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-024-07376-y)) presents the differences in temperature indices between EURO-CORDEX GCM-RCM combinations and E-OBS for various elevations, comparing summer and winter, with values based on the 1971‚Äì2000 period. The cold bias became more pronounced with lower temperatures, particularly in winter and with increasing elevation. Smaller biases were observed below 1000 m, while above this threshold and during winter, all considered RCMs exhibited a strong cold bias.

    "Even though local-scale forcing misrepresentation plays a paramount role in driving the above-mentioned cold biases, large-scale-forcing-related biases can also exacerbate or mitigate temperature biases in mountainous areas (e.g., Lhotka et al., 2018 [[22]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-016-2031-3) and Maraun et al., 2021 [[23]](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JD032824)), especially during the winter season. In RCMs, these biases may stem from inherited large-scale misrepresentations introduced by the driving global climate model, or from processes internal to the RCM formulation. Importantly, the presence of such biases does not imply that RCM data offer no added value over GCM outputs. On the contrary, RCMs ‚Äî particularly in regions with complex orography ‚Äî can provide more realistic representations of local climate processes, and their added value should not be overlooked, even when biases persist. An example of this can be found in Bilbao-Barrenetxea et al., 2024 [[24]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-024-07318-8), which assessed the added value of using EURO-CORDEX over the complex orography of the Pyrenees compared to GCMs.\n",

    "Based on the results of this assessment, users need to be cautious when using the temperature projections provided by these tools. Notably, cold biases over the Alps are systematic only in winter across all EURO-CORDEX models above 1000‚ÄØm, with the magnitude of the bias increasing with elevation. Contrary to what might be expected, these winter biases in mountainous regions cannot be solely attributed to altitude underestimation by models (which would typically lead to warmer biases). Instead, as discussed throughout this notebook, these cold biases arise from complex interactions within the models‚Äô numerical schemes, particularly in the treatment of snow and ice processes, which result in the underestimation of surface temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias-adjustment techniques can partially relieve the assessed cold temperature biases. In particular, it can reduce the present-day discrepancies between modelled and observed temperature fields (Matiu et al., 2024 [[14]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-024-07376-y), *Figure .6b*). However, bias-adjustment methods do not guarantee that the adjusted projected results will better match future reality, since the bias may not be stationary in a changing climate (e.g., Schmith et al., 2021 [[31]](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-273-2021)). Special consideration should also be given to the representation of physical relationships among variables subjected to bias adjustment (Gennaretti et al., 2015 [[32]](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JD023890)), as well as to unphysical artefacts such as the damping or amplification of original simulation trends, particularly in regions with complex orography (Sangelantoni et al., 2019 [[33]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2406-8)). Furthermore, different bias-adjustment methods do not always improve downstream products, as no single technique works reliably across all locations, variables, and applications.\n",

    "The assessed temperature and mountain snowpack biases influence the current regional climate models' ability to quantify water availability in mountain areas and, consequently, the capability to estimate changes in resources for local and downstream hydrology and economic sectors, such as tourism, hydropower, and agriculture."
