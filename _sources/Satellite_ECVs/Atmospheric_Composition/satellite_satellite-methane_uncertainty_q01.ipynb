    "Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, representing about 19% of the total radiative forcing by long living greenhouse gases [[1]](https://library.wmo.int/viewer/68532/?offset=#page=4&viewer=picture&o=bookmarks&n=0&q=).  Natural wetlands account for up to 30% of global methane (CH4) emissions, but a large uncertainty (up to 65%) still affects tropical wetland CH4 emission estimates [[2]](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-1561-2020). The positive response of wetland CH4 emissions to climate change is an important feedback that can amplify atmospheric CH4 values. This response can be related to the effect of rising temperatures on microbial activities (e.g., methanogenesis) and to the expansion of wetlands with increased total precipitations. Intensified wetland CH4 emissions have been reported during 2000‚Äì2021 ([[3]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-023-01629-0)), highlighting the need for sustained monitoring and observations of global wetland CH4 fluxes. Moreover, future projections of wetland CH4 emissions suggested sustained emission increase under different climate change scenarios ([[3]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-023-01629-0) and [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay4444)). Satellite observations can represent a powerful tool for contributing to enhance the knowledge about CH4 sources and sinks. While these data are commonly used in inverse modelling system (e.g., [[5]](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/datasets/cams-global-greenhouse-gas-inversion?tab=overview)), this assessment explores the possibility to directly use satellite CH4 data for investigate year-to-year anomalies in CH4 emissions of tropical wetlands."
