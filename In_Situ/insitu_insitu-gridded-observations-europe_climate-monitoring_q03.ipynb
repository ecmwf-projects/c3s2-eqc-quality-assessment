    "## Quality Statement question\n",
    "* **How consistent are the estimates of precipitation and wind speed trends from E-OBS compared to those from reanalysis products?** \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Use Case we will access the E-OBS daily gridded meteorological data for Europe from 1950 to present derived from in-situ observations (henceforth, E-OBS) data from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and analyse the spatial consistency of the E-OBS air temperature climatology over a given Area of Interest (AoI).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Quality Statements of this Use Case are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accordingly, with [Bandhauer, M. et al (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7269), both E-OBS and ERA5 demonstrate accuracy in capturing precipitation patterns, with E-OBS showing good agreement in regions with dense station networks while ERA5 exhibits consistent mesoscale pattern representation. The authors also concluded that E-OBS can capture extreme values of precipitation in areas with high data density but may smooth out extreme events in data-sparse regions, however ERA5 shows improved detection of extreme precipitation events due to advanced physical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Rivoire P., Martius O. and Naveau P. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001633) studied the consistency of precipitation and wind speed trends in ERA-5 compared to 2 observational datasets (E-OBS and CMORPH) analysis; since ERA-5 offers regular spatial and temporal coverage, the precipitation data are derived from short-term forecasts (not observations), the authors wanted to fill the gap in large-scale assessments of ERA-5 comparing it with E-OBS over Europe and globally with CMORPH, emphasizing intensity distribution and co-occurrence of events. The authors showed that ERA-5 demonstrated a high level of accuracy in capturing precipitation trends compared to E-OBS, in Europe where discrepancies are smaller. However, they found some differences in extreme precipitation events, indicating potential precision limitations in ERA-5 data, especially in tropical regions.\n",

    "#### Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To search for data, visit the CDS website: http://cds.climate.copernicus.eu. Here you can search for 'in-situ observations' using the search bar. The data we need for this tutorial is the E-OBS daily gridded meteorological data for Europe from 1950 to present derived from in-situ observations. This catalogue entry provides a daily gridded dataset of historical meteorological observations, covering Europe (land-only), from 1950 to the present. This data is derived from in-situ meteorological stations, made available through the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) project, as provided by National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and other data-holding institutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "E-OBS comprises a set of spatially continuous Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) from the Surface Atmosphere, following the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) convention, provided as the mean and spread of the spatial prediction ensemble algorithm, at regular latitude-longitude grid intervals (at a 0.1° and 0.25° spatial resolution), and covering a long time-period, from 1 January 1950 to present-day. In addition to the land surface elevation, E-OBS includes daily air temperature (mean, maximum and minimum), precipitation amount, wind speed, sea-level pressure and shortwave downwelling radiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The E-OBS version used for this Use Case, E-OBSv28.0e, was released in October 2023 and its main difference from the previous E-OBSv27.0e is the inclusion of new series and some corrections for precipitation stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having selected the correct dataset, we now need to specify what product type, variables, temporal and geographic coverage we are interested in. In this Use Case, the ensemble mean of precipitation (RR) and daily mean wind speed (FG) will be used, considering the last version available (v28.0e). These can all be selected in the “Download data” tab from the CDS. In this tab a form appears in which we will select the following parameters to download, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Type: Ensemble mean  \n",
    "- Variable: daily precipitation sum and daily mean wind speed\n",
    "- Grid resolution: 0.25  \n",
    "- Period: Full period  \n",
    "- Version: 28.0e  \n",
    "- Format: Zip file (.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the download form, select `Show API request`. This will reveal a block of code, which you can simply copy and paste into a cell of your Jupyter Notebook …\n",
    "\n",
    "Download data\n",
    "… having copied the API request to a Jupyter Notebook cell, running it will retrieve and download the data you requested into your local directory. However, before you run it, the `terms and conditions` of this particular dataset need to have been accepted directly at the CDS website. The option to view and accept these conditions is given at the end of the download form, just above the `Show API request` option. In addition, it is also useful to define the time period and AoI parameters and edit the request accordingly, as exemplified in the cells below."
