    "Polar lows are intense mesoscale low-pressure systems that form when cold polar air masses move over the ocean (e.g., Stoll et al., 2021). They have attracted and continue to attract considerable attention due to their relevance for the climate system and their impact on society (e.g., Moreno-Ibanez et al., 2021). From a climate perspective, for example, polar lows contribute to the heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere by inducing intense sensible and latent heat fluxes. From a societal perspective, they can generate intense winds which, in turn, can severely disrupt human activities and pose a threat to lives at sea and in coastal areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Atmospheric reanalyses are invaluable tools for studying polar lows. At first, they do not only rely on observations, but also incorporate model-based forecasts (Parker, 2016). Indeed, observations alone are often insufficient due to their limited number in the Arctic (Moreno-Ib√°√±ez, 2024) combined with the small sizes of polar lows, which range between 200 and 1000 km (Moreno-Ib√°√±ez, 2024). Additionally, atmospheric reanalysis offer the advantage of being provided on regular grids, at consistent temporal intervals, and over extended periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this respect, ERA5, the fifth generation of the ECMWF global atmospheric reanalysis (Hersbach et al., 2020), has been widely used to study polar lows (Moreno-Ib√°√±ez, 2024). For example, Stoll (2022) used ERA5 to report on the global climatology of polar lows, Meyer et al. (2021) to study their 3-dimensional structures, and Boyd et al. (2022) to determine the large-scale atmospheric conditions where polar lows develop. Furthermore, Stoll et al. (2021) suggested the ability of ERA5 to detect a larger number of polar lows than ERA Interim, the previous generation of the ECMWF global atmospheric reanalysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its importance, though, ERA5 has its own limitations. Notably, it has a spatial resolution of 0.25¬∞x0.25¬∞, which is insufficient to capture the fine horizontal spatial-scale features of polar lows. Additionally, it has been noted to underestimate near-surface wind speeds associated with polar lows (e.g., Gurvich et al., 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "A regional reanalysis, such as the Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA), can help partly overcome these limitations. Although restricted to the European sector of the Arctic, CARRA has a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5 km, which is finer than that of ERA5 and can therefore potentially better characterize the physical properties of polar lows. Furthermore, it assimilates a larger number of observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its potential, though, the ability of CARRA to capture and describe polar lows needs to be assessed. The present review reports on the capabilities of CARRA and ERA5 on pressure levels to detect polar lows over the European Arctic through a literature revision. \n"

The assessment is based on the [Full System Documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Copernicus+Arctic+Regional+Reanalysis+%28CARRA%29%3A+Full+system+documentation) of CARRA, and addresses temperature and wind speed between approximately 950 and 50 hPa for September 1997, January 2000, and April 2007. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Figures 1 and 2 indicate that the observed temperature and wind speed agree better with the estimates from CARRA than from ERA5. CARRA outperforms ERA5 in terms of both bias and standard deviation, with improvements of up to 50 percentage points. The improvememt appears to depend on the pressure level, being it less pronounced or absent for pressure levels below approximately 200hPa, while showing little dependence on year and season, although additional analysis is likely needed to confirm this conclusion due the limited number of years considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results for the standard deviation differentiate between temperature and wind speed, with CARRA offering a greater improvement over ERA5 in terms of wind speed rather than temperature. For instance, selecting wind speed data from CARRA, as opposed to ERA5, reduces the average standard deviation by up to 50 percentage points circa, compared to around 30 percentage points for temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison with the observed temperature and wind speed indicates that both CARRA and ERA5 are negatively biased at most pressure levels. However, unlike the standard deviation, this comparison does not clearly distinguish between temperature and wind speed. The result for the bias is important as it suggests that both reanalysis datasets tend to underestimate the observed temperature and wind speed throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere."

At first, both reanalysis datasets place the centre of the polar low at approximately 72¬∞N, but CARRA has it shifted circa 2¬∞ to the east with respect to ERA5. More notably, though, CARRA appears to reproduce the finer structures of the polar low when compared to ERA5. In particular, CARRA indicates that the tail of the polar low is thinner and has a relative vorticity which is higher than that provided by ERA5 and comparable to the polar low's centre. CARRA also reveals stripes of high relative vorticity to the west and south of the eye. A comparison with the satellite image shown in Figure 3 indicates that these features exist and replicate the wave-like elements observed in the satellite data.

    "This assessment presented a brief literature review to evaluate the consistency of the ERA5 and CARRA reanalysis datasets on pressure levels with observational data. It also compared the ability of these datasets to replicate the characteristics of polar lows in the European Arctic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison with radiosonde data, based on CARRA's documentation, indicates that CARRA reproduces temperature and wind speed better than ERA5 in terms of bias and standard deviation, particularly for pressure levels higher than approximately 200 hPa. However, further analysis is likely needed, as the results presented in this assessment are based on a limited number of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "A case study of a polar low presented by Cheng (2023) indicates that CARRA is preferable to ERA5 for reproducing the features of polar lows. A satellite image of the polar low was used as a reference for the comparison. The comparison showed that CARRA provided a finer representation of the center and tail of the polar low, less diffused relative vorticity values, and a better representation of the features around the polar low when compared to ERA5. Thus, in line with CARRA's documentation, CARRA is expected to better reproduce high-impact weather events than ERA5 in the European sector of the Arctic. \n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we would like to note that the results reported by this assessment agree with the conclusions reached by previous works who assessed the ability of CARRA and ERA5 on single levels to reproduce polar lows. For example, Khachatrian and Asemann (2024) showed that CARRA provides a more detailed representation of the 10m wind field than ERA5 during a polar low event. K√∏ltzow et al. (2022) further highlight CARRA's ability over ERA5 to better reproduce the 2m temperature and the 10m wind field associated with polar lows as they wave over land. "
