    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial seasonal means and trends** are presented and assessed using the new **XCO2 v4.4 Level 3 gridded product (OBS4MIPS)**, which has been generated using the Level 2 EMMA products [[2]](http://wdc.dlr.de/C3S_312b_Lot2/Documentation/GHG/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_GHG_main_latest.pdf) as input. \n",
    "**No data sub-setting or selection has been performed**, neither as a function of the number of individual Level 2 observations leading to the reported Level 3 values (\"co2_nobs\"), nor as a function of the standard error (\"xco2_stderr\") provided in the data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To show how data coverage varies between years and seasons**, we have calculated and plotted the **average XCO2 values for singular seasons and years**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial trends** are calculated using a linear model (i.e. Theil-Sen slope estimator) over monthly anomalies (i.e. actual monthly values minus climatological monthly means). **This should be treated with caution as the long-term trend of atmospheric CO2 is not strictly linear**. The statistical significance of the trends is assessed using the Mann-Kendall test. Similar to [[3]](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/13/789/2020/), only land pixels are considered to avoid artefacts related to different data availability over oceans (the data product is land only for 2003-2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis and results are organised in the following steps, which are detailed in the sections below: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. [Section A](#section-a) 'Choose the data to use and set-up the code':**\n",
    " * Import all the relevant packages\n",
    " * Choose the temporal and spatial coverage, land mask\n",
    " * Chache needed functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. [Section B](#section-b) 'Retrieve XCO2 data (OBS4MIPS)':**\n",
    " * In this section, we define the data request to CDS. *Please note that users have to accept the GHG-CCI Licence for getting the dataset (see [[4]](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-carbon-dioxide?tab=overview)).*\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. [Section C](#section-d) 'Compute and plot the global variability of seasonal XCO2':**\n",
    " * To show how data coverage varies between years and seasons, we have plotted spatial average XCO2 values for seasons and years. Seasons are defined as December - February (DJF), March - May (MAM), June - August (JJA) and September – November  (SON).\n",

The tropics and the middle and high latitudes are the regions that are not covered by measurements throughout the year or are characterised by higher uncertainty (see also [[3]](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/13/789/2020/)), and therefore the trend values are more variable and in some cases not statistically significant."
